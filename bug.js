This error occurs when you try to use a feature from a package that is not correctly installed or linked in your Expo project.  It often manifests as a runtime error, not a compilation error, because the bundler might initially seem to include the package, but the actual code or native modules are missing at runtime. This is common with native modules, particularly those requiring linking or specific build configurations.
