# Expo Runtime Error: Missing Native Module

This repository demonstrates a common error in Expo projects where native modules fail to load at runtime, resulting in unexpected behavior or crashes.  The error often lacks clear messaging, making debugging challenging.

## Problem Description
The project uses a package that depends on native modules (e.g., a camera library). These modules aren't properly linked during the Expo build process, causing the app to crash or exhibit unexpected behavior during runtime.  The error messages might be vague, not directly pointing to the missing module.
