The solution involves carefully verifying package installation and linking within the Expo project.  If using EAS Build, ensure the correct build configurations are set.

1. **Verify Package Installation:** Double-check that the problematic package is correctly installed using `expo list:deps`.
2. **Check Package Integrity:**  Examine the package's documentation. Some may require specific Expo SDK versions or have unique linking procedures.
3. **Ensure Proper Linking (if necessary):**  For packages with native modules, linking is often crucial.  This step varies depending on the package and method of building (Expo Go vs. EAS Build).
4. **EAS Build Configurations (if applicable):**  If using EAS Build, the `eas.json` or relevant build config file might need modifications to include necessary native modules or build options.
5. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Sometimes, a simple clean and rebuild (`expo prebuild --clean && expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`) can resolve temporary linking issues.
6. **Expo Go Limitations:** Keep in mind that Expo Go might not support all native modules. For certain packages, standalone builds or bare workflow might be required.
7. **Debug with Logging:** Add console logs to pinpoint the exact location of the error.  This can help identify the missing module more precisely.
